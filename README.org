* Use

This current has:

- a running (online) version for basic mean and variance.
- a running version with exponential weighting.
- a running correlation.

* Basis

This is almost a straight rip from Statistics class oflthe python runstats
package by Grant Jenks:

    [[https://github.com/grantjenks/python-runstats]]

It also includes some other running statistics class from the GNU Statistics
Library:

    [[https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/]]

* Future

I want to add the Regression class from runstats and some other algorithms
from GSL that I need.

* Warnings

This untested code with no optimization thought. Hopefully that will improve,
but my priorities shifted a little. Help is welcome.
